              Here, we leverage the sea urchin embryo for its well-established
              gene regulatory network to interrogate the embryo using single
              cell RNA sequencing. We tested eight developmental stages in
              Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, from the eight-cell stage to late
              in gastrulation. We used these datasets to parse out 22 major
              cell states of the embryo, focusing on key transition stages for
              cell type specification of each germ layer. Subclustering of
              these major embryonic domains revealed over 50 cell states with
              distinct transcript profiles. Furthermore, we identified the
              transcript profile of two cell states expressing germ cell
              factors, one we conclude represents the primordial germ cells and
              the other state is transiently present during gastrulation. We
              hypothesize that these cells of the Veg2 tier of the early embryo
              represent a lineage that converts to the germ line when the
              primordial germ cells are deleted. This broad resource will
              hopefully enable the community to identify other cell states and
              genes of interest to expose the underpinning of developmental
              mechanisms.",
